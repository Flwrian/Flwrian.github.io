## Aspira: The Project That Changed How I See Code

Aspira didn’t just teach me about chess engines it taught me about myself as a developer. When I started, I thought it would be a fun side project. Write some code, make a bot play chess, maybe learn a few tricks. I had no idea what I was getting into.

The first time Aspira played a legal game, I was like a kid. But very quickly, reality caught up with me: perft tests exploding, impossible-to-isolate bugs, architecture collapsing as soon as I tried to push further. I spent nights tracking down errors that weren’t typos, but mistakes in logic, understanding, and design. I realized that in a chess engine, everything is connected, and the slightest approximation can cost you dearly.

I threw everything away. Started from scratch. Not out of perfectionism, but because it was the only way to move forward. This time, I put correctness above all. Bitboards, magic bitboards, clean make/unmake functions, tests at every step. And only when everything was solid did I start chasing performance. The result? 20 million nodes per second, but more importantly, an engine where I understand every line, every choice.

But the most important lesson was about myself: patience, humility, the ability to doubt, to start over, to seek not the "clever" solution but the right one. Aspira is the project that taught me that true satisfaction doesn’t come from raw performance, but from deep understanding and the journey taken to get there.

The name "Aspira" comes from "aspiring": to understand, to build, to go further. And somewhere along the way, this project ended up aspiring me too. And that’s what makes it precious.
