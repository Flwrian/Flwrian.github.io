## Building Remote Management at Alemca

I spent 1.5 years at Alemca, a Montpellier startup building IoT remote management solutions. This is where theory met reality and I truly learned what it means to work on production systems.

**What I Did**: I renovated the web application (Flask, Jinja templates), architected data and file management modules, made technical decisions (InfluxDB, S3 storage, etc.), and designed APIs that other services depended on.

**What I Learned**: Architectural decisions have long-term consequences. Clean code isn't optional at scale. Security must be built in from the start. Technical debt trade-offs are constant. Communication is as important as code quality.

One of the best parts of my time at Alemca was the team. I had the chance to work with talented, passionate people who were always willing to share their knowledge and challenge each other to do better. The atmosphere was both demanding and supportive: we could debate architecture, joke about bugs, and celebrate wins together. I learned a lot from my colleagues, and I’m genuinely grateful for the trust and autonomy I was given. Looking back, I realize how much this environment helped me grow not just technically, but also in how I communicate, collaborate, and approach problems as a team.
