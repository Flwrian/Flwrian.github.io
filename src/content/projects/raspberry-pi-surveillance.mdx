title: "Home Surveillance with Raspberry Pi"
role: "Maker & Developer"
year: 2023
duration: "1 month"
teamSize: 1
outcomeSummary: "Built a complete home surveillance system using Raspberry Pi and camera module. Learned about video streaming, motion detection, network security, and embedded systems programming."
overview: "A hands-on project to create a home surveillance system from scratch using a Raspberry Pi and camera module. The goal wasn't just to have a security camera - it was to deeply understand how video streaming works, how motion detection algorithms function, and how to secure networked devices."
problem: "Wanted to understand how modern surveillance systems work under the hood. Commercial solutions are black boxes - you use them but don't understand them. Building one from scratch forces you to solve real problems: video capture, motion detection, network streaming, storage management, and security."
constraints:
  - "Limited Raspberry Pi hardware resources"
  - "Need real-time video processing"
  - "Network bandwidth considerations"
  - "Secure remote access requirement"
  - "Storage management for video recordings"
approach: "Start with basic video capture, then progressively add features: motion detection, remote streaming, storage management, and security. Each feature required understanding different aspects of the system - from low-level camera interfacing to network protocols."
keyDecisions:
  - decision: "Python with OpenCV for video processing"
    reasoning: "OpenCV provides mature computer vision algorithms. Python offers rapid development for prototyping. Performance was adequate for single-camera setup on Pi hardware."
    alternatives:
      - "C++ for maximum performance (overkill for single camera)"
      - "Built-in motion tools (less learning, less control)"
  - decision: "RTSP for video streaming"
    reasoning: "Industry-standard protocol with good support. Allows viewing from multiple devices. Works with standard media players without custom apps."
    alternatives:
      - "Custom WebRTC solution (more complex, unnecessary for use case)"
      - "Simple HTTP streaming (less efficient, higher latency)"
  - decision: "Local storage with automatic cleanup"
    reasoning: "Keep recordings locally with automatic deletion of old footage. Simple, no cloud dependencies, maintains privacy."
    alternatives:
      - "Cloud storage (monthly costs, privacy concerns)"
      - "External hard drive (additional hardware, power consumption)"
techStack:
  - "Raspberry Pi"
  - "Python"
  - "OpenCV"
  - "RTSP streaming"
  - "Motion detection algorithms"
  - "SSH for remote access"
  - "Systemd for service management"
impact:
  metrics:
    - label: "Cost"
      value: "~$50 total"
    - label: "Detection Accuracy"
      value: "Good (tunable)"
    - label: "Latency"
      value: "<1 second"
  qualitative: "This project taught me embedded systems programming, computer vision basics, network streaming protocols, and practical security considerations. More importantly, it demonstrated my approach to learning: pick a real problem, build a solution from scratch, understand every component deeply. The system works reliably and I understand exactly how and why."
learnings:
  - "Video processing is computationally intensive - optimization matters"
  - "Motion detection requires tuning for different environments (lighting, movement patterns)"
  - "Network streaming protocols have different trade-offs (latency vs quality vs bandwidth)"
  - "Embedded systems have resource constraints that force careful design"
  - "Security is critical for networked devices - proper authentication, encrypted connections"
  - "System reliability requires proper error handling and service management"

## What I Built

### Core Components

**Video Capture**
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module integration
- Frame capture and processing pipeline
- Resolution and framerate optimization for Pi hardware

**Motion Detection**
- Background subtraction algorithm
- Configurable sensitivity thresholds
- Zone-based detection (ignore certain areas)
- Timestamped event logging

**Video Streaming**
- RTSP server for live video
- Low-latency streaming to multiple clients
- Accessible from local network
- Standard media player compatibility

**Storage Management**
- Automatic recording on motion detection
- Organized by date and time
- Automatic cleanup of old recordings
- Configurable retention period

**Remote Access**
- Secure SSH access
- VPN for remote viewing
- No open ports to internet
- Proper authentication

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Performance on Limited Hardware

Raspberry Pi isn't powerful. Processing video in real-time required:
- Efficient frame processing
- Downscaling resolution where appropriate
- Optimized motion detection algorithm
- Careful CPU usage management

**Lesson**: Optimization matters on resource-constrained devices.

### 2. False Positives in Motion Detection

Initial implementation triggered on:
- Light changes (clouds, car headlights)
- Tree branches moving
- Pets moving around

**Solution**: 
- Adjustable sensitivity
- Minimum motion size threshold
- Zone masking for problem areas
- Time-based rules (different sensitivity day/night)

**Lesson**: Algorithms need tuning for real-world conditions.

### 3. Network Streaming Stability

Video streaming failed when:
- Wi-Fi signal weak
- Multiple clients connected
- Network congestion

**Solution**:
- Buffer management
- Automatic quality adjustment
- Connection retry logic
- Wired ethernet for stability

**Lesson**: Network reliability matters for real-time systems.

### 4. Security Concerns

Networked camera is security risk:
- Default passwords
- Unencrypted streams
- Open ports
- Vulnerable services

**Solution**:
- Strong authentication
- VPN access only
- No direct internet exposure
- Regular security updates

**Lesson**: Security must be designed in from the start.

## What This Taught Me

### Computer Vision Basics

- How cameras capture video
- Frame processing pipelines
- Motion detection algorithms
- Background subtraction techniques

### Network Protocols

- RTSP streaming protocol
- Video encoding and compression
- Network bandwidth management
- Latency vs quality trade-offs

### Embedded Systems

- Resource constraints matter
- Optimization for limited CPU/RAM
- Power management considerations
- Hardware interfacing (camera module)

### System Reliability

- Service management (systemd)
- Error handling and recovery
- Logging and monitoring
- Automatic restart on failure

### Security Practices

- Authentication and authorization
- Network security (VPN, firewall)
- Attack surface minimization
- Update management

## Why This Project Mattered

**It wasn't about having a security camera** - I could buy one for $50.

**It was about understanding how they work** by building one from scratch.

This is my learning philosophy:
1. Pick something you're curious about
2. Build it yourself
3. Hit real problems
4. Solve them properly
5. Understand deeply

Every challenge solved taught me something applicable to other projects:
- Performance optimization techniques
- Real-time processing constraints
- Network protocol understanding
- Security considerations
- Embedded systems programming

## Current Status

The system runs reliably:
- Automatic startup on boot
- Continuous operation for months
- Regular automatic cleanup
- Secure remote access when needed

It's not the most feature-rich surveillance system. But it's one I built and fully understand.

## Related Learning

This project led to other explorations:
- Development server setup with Docker
- Network architecture understanding
- Additional IoT projects
- Distributed systems interests

Each project builds on previous learning.

## The Bigger Picture

This is a small project in the grand scheme. But it exemplifies my approach:

**I don't just use technology - I understand it.**

Building a surveillance system taught me about:
- Computer vision
- Network streaming
- Embedded systems
- Security practices
- System reliability

All applicable to larger, more complex systems.
